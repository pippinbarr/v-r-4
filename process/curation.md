# Curation

## Introduction

This is going to be (in theory) a document where I'll write about curation strategies and so on - is that even a term? Anyway, I want to examine the set of potential assets and take notes about interesting works/assets and why they're interesting. I want to think about the curation heuristics and why I would choose one thing and not another. And I want to think about the actual exhibition staging and where I should put things and why I should put them there. And I want to think about any kind of information design that may well prove necessary.

I don't want this to function as a diary, I want it to be a practical document that gathers my thoughts together, okay? Got it, buster?

## Asset review

### Purchased

* [Saraha Desert Landscape](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/sahara-desert-landscape-72780)
  * **Author:** Black Sun
  * **Category**: 3D > Environments > Landscapes / 3D Landscapes
  * **Medium**: Terrain/Landscape, Skybox (?)
  * **Purchased**: 7 May 2021
  * Just noticed this is in a series of categories: 3D > Environments > Landscapes. Could that be a useful thing to include on the didact? Yes probably.
  * It's a fairly large terrain textured to look like the Sahara Desert (I don't know how accurate it is, I suppose you could also say it "is" the Sahara Desert if you wanted to), nice detailed bumpy sand normal map, nice rippling dunes
  * This is a big decision potentially because it's the actual environment of the entire exhibition
  * Evocations of *Ozymandias*, evocations of Marfa and the Chinati Foundation, evocations of wandering lost in the desert and Biblical stuff
  * It's very big and yet it costs so little!
  * It's very repetitive and information light and yet it costs so much!
  * Actually that duality of "It's so cheap because..."/"It's so expensive because..." is a useful framing for assets when I'm thinking about them

* [PBR Statues Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/pbr-statues-pack-91623)
  * **Author**: Maksim Bugrimov
  * **Category**: 3D > Environments > Fantasy / 3D Fantasy
  * **Medium**: 3D Models (?)
  * **Purchased**: 11 May 2021
  * It's a set of high resolution and fancy-looking statues that dabble in cultural appropriation.
  * PBR apparently means Physically Based Rendering. It has a bunch of light and reflection probes. Basically they seem like they're trying to be super fancy statues, and I suppose that they succeed at that!
  * I chose them first (after the desert) as something kind of typically "museum ready" that would stabilize the project and my own process of curation, a kind of back to basics thing. They look pretty nice in the desert and they "make sense" in an easy way.
  * They set up potential tensions with assets that are lower or different resolutions or styles, they're also relatively small in scale, they're also deeply inanimate and don't "do" anything.
  * They seem to exist for set decoration of a similarly fancy level of some kind of Uncharted-adjacent game? That's what they evoke for me. Third person action exploration. Actually I wonder if genre is a curatorial standpoint. Variety of genre.

### Considerations

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/10-simple-spaceships-4709
  * Cartoon spaceship models x 10
  * Has that "recommended by our users" stamp of approval
  * Fundamentally it's... just some spaceships
  * In many ways this feels oddly similar to the statues... a collection of objects... different art style though, which is clearly a diversity consideration

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/100-low-poly-head-wear-items-128855
  * 100 low poly hats is pretty fucking funny
  * Definitely want to get some LARGE AMOUNT OF X thing(s) in there
  * They could be in a pile?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/125-low-poly-uildings-89838
  * 125 buildings is pretty intriguing, 200 prefabs
  * Interesting they don't seem to be assembled into a place, just buildings on their own?
  * Points out a difference between assets that are presented as objects and assets presented with an eye to their actual use in a game (e.g. here's the buildings and here's a world with those buildings)
  * So could be worthwhile as a brute amount - again there's some chance to configure these in some interesting way?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/18th-century-door-and-window-pack-4433
  * Doors and windows
  * I like the idea of a component part of a building divorced from its actual context like this
  * Plus imagery like a door in the desert is so classically evocative?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/industrial/200l-metal-barrel-with-substance-37598
  * Just three prefabbed barrels is funny (though there's a lot of customaization stuff which is interesting)

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/weapons/2-handed-frost-axe-20503
  * An axe... there's definitely a need for one or more "it's just this little thing" entries right?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/weapons/35-guns-weapons-and-pick-ups-lowpoly-98744
  * Some guns - probably something I "have to" have right? Weapons?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/3d-alphabet-122263
  * Characters - Language is a nice one

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/interior/3d-asset-pack-russian-izba-cabin-194082
  * A Russian cabin
  * Interesting because it's a room, though doesn't look like they've got a demo scene properly done?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/3d-castle-level-textures-182077
  * Really interestingly awkward, looks kind of isometric despite being 3D?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/furniture/3d-furniture-pack-163118
  * Furniture is a must
  * Has a sample scene that I'm guessing will be some kind of room?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/3d-pixel-vehicle-pack-devil-s-garage-104162
  * Some cars

* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/3d-scans-forest-pack-133837
  * A scan of a forest - looks like it has a scene inside a really awkward box which could be beautiful as an installation

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/guns/45mm-pistol-163916
  * Just one gun
  * Something like this has comedy value in terms of paying a lot for just a gun?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/4-forest-trees-468
  * Trees are appealing
  * Nature is appealing

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/electronics/70s-radio-pbr-150035

  * A lot of fucking rocks

* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/9t5-low-poly-arsenal-161274
  * Another one with a room for display which is interesting. Plus it's weaponry.
  * This creator has a bunch of stuff in this vein
  * e.g. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/9t5-low-poly-casino-166968
  * e.g. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/9t5-low-poly-bowling-alley-modular-132238
  * e.g. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/9t5-low-poly-arsenal-161274
  * e.g.  https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/9t5-low-poly-convenience-store-157383
  * I think the convenience store is the winner? Wait there's a church

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/abandoned-house-94448
  * An abandoned house is nice...
  * But also: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/abandoned-village-pack-161219

  * Ha ha an adjustable wrench. Sooooo basic.

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/adonis-city-low-poly-165613
  * A city! Probably has a scene with it citified?
  * This is making me think about the problems of the desert landscape though... it's fine for some things to be in the sand but some stuff that's larger might get quite fucked over by that?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/air-conditioner-37139
  * One example of an air conditioner.
  * An air conditioner in the desert is funny.
  * Also just a really prosaic object is fun.

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/allien-creature-157071
  * Pleasingly gross alien
  * General idea of character models in different kinds
  * You can see some sort of typology building up that it would be useful to represent?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/american-desert-town-trailer-50958
  * A trailer is nice

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/an-abandoned-castle-53485

  * All this continues to make me think a lot about cultural appropriation

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/animal-pack-47588
  * An animal pack
  * A genre so worth looking at a number before buying one

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/animated-cardboard-box-32492

* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/animated-farm-windmill-windpump-143450
  * Farm windmill. I need it.

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/animated-racing-arrows-78717
  * A UI element (racing arrows) is quite interesting

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/anime-character-code-lanky-contain-vrm-183464
  * Lots of anime characters
  * This one has a backstory: "Character name : Code:Lanky / Character age:Unknown / Character information:From a Western country, living with her husband in a mountains villa. Because her husband made a lot of money in his career, his personality became increasingly arrogant . The relationship between the husband and wife gradually expanded, and fell in love with other women ,which eventually led to tragedies. In order to avenge the unfeeling husband, a series of avenge were launched : Bloody Action..."
  * That idea is pretty alluring... built in narrative
  * ALso just interesting the extent to which creators do or do not include this kind of thing
  * Some kind of rendering of the creator's description is really interesting and appealing... what they choose to emphasize etc...

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/interior/antique-fireplace-115525
  * Antiques is a thing
  * This is a fireplace which is quite fun and cosy

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/food/apples-perfect-and-bite-664
  * A bunch of apples
  * I mean, how the fuck am I going to work with all this? So many things are so funny!

* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/arc-ai37-007-126328
  * Fancy room
  * Very realistic etc. pretty good candidate though has a lot of requirements in terms of settings...

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/ash-tray-cigarette-140172
  * Ashtray and cigarette
  * Yes I'm drawn to the really boring and mundane stuff

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/auto-rikshaw-tuk-tuk-low-poly-3d-vehicle-model-13143
  * Do love a baby taxi
  * This makes me wonder to what extent this could end up being a more personal exhibition?
  * Could I tell a story of my own with the curation?
  * Part of the problem in general is that there's no story to $4.99 just a range

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/auto-rikshaw-tuk-tuk-low-poly-3d-vehicle-model-13143
  * Autumn Horror Trees

  * The ultimate deflation?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/sea/boats-pack-1-113473
  * Boats... another vehicle. Funny in a desert.
  * This is making me think about how some objects will inherit narrative properties from their situation in the landscape where others probably won't? Notably through a match of realisms? And scale...

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/mammals/bottlenose-dolphin-128643
  * A dolphin
  * Quite amazing, animated.

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/boxing-ring-large-179420
  * A boxing ring
  * This is making me think about bending $4.99 more toward architecture and implied spaces?
  * But is that just ANOTHER project that would be really interesting to do with free assets instead?
  * Diversity still feels like it should be king if my focus is on the price point

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/industrial/breakable-crate-3905
  * Breakable crate
  * Intriguing because the user could actually interact with this one, it's just a collision...

  * Intriguing with the interactive stuff
  * Could I activate their specific interactive bit through prox?
  * Prooooobably not

* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/camping-props-pbr-193403
  * Camping... nice evocation of something to do in the desert...

* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/guns/cap-gun-with-arms-38686
  * This is proooobaby too amazing not to include? Especially pending what the disembodied arm looks like?

  * Some cardboard. I mean, yeah.
  * There's a lot of this category!

  * Beautiful

### Notes on the search

* By starting with ascending order by name I'm immediately seeing packs definitely by the number of things, like 100 hats or 10 spaceships
* I'm largely thinking in terms of prefabs as a way to demo these pieces "as intended", but of course many 3D objects are instrumented in different ways, to the extent of having different settings and shaders - to do that justice I'd have to either have a combinatorial presentation (ala Unity water) or make them interactive, neither of which I plan to do. But it's a truth about the materials.
* Seeing cars over and over is starting to make me wonder about whether things could potentially be positioned near each other as a kind of comedy chain of relationships? Realistic car beside a cartoon cart? Invite those very specific comparisons? Also thinking about Patrick Pound and more conceptual connections and jokes?
* Looking into some package contents it starts looking to me a lot like some things may end up incompatibal (e.g. what if they rely on a specific rendering pipeline?) or just super confusing to actually use?
* Situating objects on the terrain could end up occluding important stuff or make larger flat stuff kind of unusable? Do I need platforms?
* If I load 96 assets per page there are 63 pages of assets at $4.99 - should I be coming up with some kind of democratizing approach where I only buy one asset per page or similar? Or does that just return me to things like the alphabet and numbers (36 items) - though with numbers it's "starts with 1" rather than has literally the number 1 at the start?
* In essence I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed by the potentially horrifyingly large selection process if I just propose to look at every single page - I've reached page 5 of 63 as I write this and each page is some WORK (I've been doing it for well over an hour, probably longer... can easily imagine looking at every page taking like 16+ hours, and I kind of question what I'll even be left with after that? There are many, many interesting assets.)
* Another option is purely random selection, but then I'm just abdicating responsibility for what ends up in it, and I've already broken that with the landscape and if it chose another landscape I'd be in trouble anyway
* I can imagine going by categories (vehicles, characters, buildings, interiors, etc.) but it gets really arbitrary and false done that way...
* The advantage to "one per page" or "one every N assets" would just be the ability to know I'm picking one amongst a group? There's just too much interesting stuff. A v r free would be an interesting follow-up by the way. Eh. v r $0 (like a weird prequel movie hehe)
* FUCK this is challenging.
* OKAY, part of the problem is that almost EVERYTHING IS AMAZING, there are just so many interesting things to look at in all of this... starts to feel like I could curate just a slice through at one item per page and go ahead with it because there are usually a significant number per page that I find very, very interesting
* I keep oscillating between "choose per page" and then also "choose per category" and some combination of those. The choose per page strategy risks building a non-diverse set where I get to later pages and am scraping the metaphorical barrel mesh trying to find a specific representative, but the choose per category makes it hard to find things and also probably hard to hit all the categories?
* Probably makes sense to try to make a list of "what I want" somehow... but some of these things just have real je ne sais quoi about them... half eaten apples? I mean, how can you categorize and pick for something like that? It's just so great?
* OH SHIT UNITY HAS DEEPER CATEGORIES THAN I THOUGHT?!
  * Characters
    * Animals
      * Birds
      * Fish
      * Insects
      * Mammals
      * Reptiles
    * Creatures
    * Humanoids
      * Fantasy
      * Humans
      * Sci-Fi
    * Robots
  * Environments
    * Dungeons
    * Fantasy
    * Historic
    * Industrial
    * Landscapes
    * Roadways
    * Sci-Fi
    * Urban
  * Props
    * Clothing
      * Accessories
      * Armor
    * Electronics
    * Exterior
    * Food
    * Furniture
    * Guns
    * Industrial
    * Interior
    * Tools
    * Weapons
  * Vegetation
    * Flowers
    * Plants
    * Trees
  * Vehicles
    * Air
    * Land
    * Sea
    * Space
* HOWEVER note that not everything is in one of those categories. How would you find the uncategorized things? Or do I just ignore them? And who defined those categories anyway? Like, you can't just go down to the leaves and get full coverage
* Gosh though it would be neat to just say "sample every category"? Maybe even two things per category to get a sense of comparison within them?
* I'm feeling PRETTY SWAYED by that strategy guys...

## Curatorial heuristics

My plan here is to develop a set of rationales for why one work and not another.

### Variety

* I think my baseline decision making should be around displaying a variety of assets at the price point so we can get a sense of the range, this will presumably invite the most questions from a player (and myself) and that's at the centre of this
* What kinds of categories are there that we can vary?
  * Resolution
  * Realism
  * Skill in execution
  * Size
  * Interactivity/activity
  * Genre connotations
  * Art style (cartoonish, low poly, realism, contemporary, etc.)
  * Quantity of elements (a single car, a collection of cars, a city, a room)
  * Genre of element (object, character, room, terrain, something else...)
  * Animation
  * Natural, fabricated
* There are a lot.

## Exhibition logistics

My plan here is to develop thoughts about how to position things in the space and why.

* Flatness. One issue is that some objects kind of require a flat space to actually work on. If you have a city street grid, say, you can't just embed the whole thing deep into sand dunes and still feel like you're doing is credit? So do I create cubic-platforms that support something like that and allow it to live its best life?
* Rooms. For interiors it may be necessary to build walls to enclose them depending on how they're implemented? I really loved my internal vision, at least, of walking into a kind of simple bunker and ending up in some beautiful room.
* Lighting. Various things look like they have their own lighting settings and preferences (and even rendering pipelines). I can imagine trouble on that front.

### Didacts

What shall they have on them?

* Name of the work
* Author of the work
* Category of the work (Is this like a medium? e.g. 3D > Environments > Landscapes)
* Price of the work ($4.99, duh)
* Purchase date/time of the work
* **Maybe** some kind of further information?
* **Ideally** some link to the official asset page
