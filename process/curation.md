# Curation

## Introduction

This is going to be (in theory) a document where I'll write about curation strategies and so on - is that even a term? Anyway, I want to examine the set of potential assets and take notes about interesting works/assets and why they're interesting. I want to think about the curation heuristics and why I would choose one thing and not another. And I want to think about the actual exhibition staging and where I should put things and why I should put them there. And I want to think about any kind of information design that may well prove necessary.

I don't want this to function as a diary, I want it to be a practical document that gathers my thoughts together, okay? Got it, buster?

## Asset review

### Purchased

* [Saraha Desert Landscape](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/sahara-desert-landscape-72780)
  * **Author:** Black Sun
  * **Category**: 3D > Environments > Landscapes / 3D Landscapes
  * **Medium**: Terrain/Landscape, Skybox (?)
  * **Purchased**: 7 May 2021
  * Just noticed this is in a series of categories: 3D > Environments > Landscapes. Could that be a useful thing to include on the didact? Yes probably.
  * It's a fairly large terrain textured to look like the Sahara Desert (I don't know how accurate it is, I suppose you could also say it "is" the Sahara Desert if you wanted to), nice detailed bumpy sand normal map, nice rippling dunes
  * This is a big decision potentially because it's the actual environment of the entire exhibition
  * Evocations of *Ozymandias*, evocations of Marfa and the Chinati Foundation, evocations of wandering lost in the desert and Biblical stuff
  * It's very big and yet it costs so little!
  * It's very repetitive and information light and yet it costs so much!
  * Actually that duality of "It's so cheap because..."/"It's so expensive because..." is a useful framing for assets when I'm thinking about them

* [PBR Statues Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/pbr-statues-pack-91623)
  * **Author**: Maksim Bugrimov
  * **Category**: 3D > Environments > Fantasy / 3D Fantasy
  * **Medium**: 3D Models (?)
  * **Purchased**: 11 May 2021
  * It's a set of high resolution and fancy-looking statues that dabble in cultural appropriation.
  * PBR apparently means Physically Based Rendering. It has a bunch of light and reflection probes. Basically they seem like they're trying to be super fancy statues, and I suppose that they succeed at that!
  * I chose them first (after the desert) as something kind of typically "museum ready" that would stabilize the project and my own process of curation, a kind of back to basics thing. They look pretty nice in the desert and they "make sense" in an easy way.
  * They set up potential tensions with assets that are lower or different resolutions or styles, they're also relatively small in scale, they're also deeply inanimate and don't "do" anything.
  * They seem to exist for set decoration of a similarly fancy level of some kind of Uncharted-adjacent game? That's what they evoke for me. Third person action exploration. Actually I wonder if genre is a curatorial standpoint. Variety of genre.


## Curatorial heuristics

My plan here is to develop a set of rationales for why one work and not another.

### Variety

* I think my baseline decision making should be around displaying a variety of assets at the price point so we can get a sense of the range, this will presumably invite the most questions from a player (and myself) and that's at the centre of this
* What kinds of categories are there that we can vary?
  * Resolution
  * Realism
  * Skill in execution
  * Size
  * Interactivity/activity
  * Genre connotations
  * ...

## Exhibition logistics

My plan here is to develop thoughts about how to position things in the space and why.

### Didacts

What shall they have on them?

* Name of the work
* Author of the work
* Category of the work (Is this like a medium? e.g. 3D > Environments > Landscapes)
* Price of the work ($4.99, duh)
* Purchase date/time of the work
* **Maybe** some kind of further information?
* **Ideally** some link to the official asset page
