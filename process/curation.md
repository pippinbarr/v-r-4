# Curation

## Introduction

This is going to be (in theory) a document where I'll write about curation strategies and so on - is that even a term? Anyway, I want to examine the set of potential assets and take notes about interesting works/assets and why they're interesting. I want to think about the curation heuristics and why I would choose one thing and not another. And I want to think about the actual exhibition staging and where I should put things and why I should put them there. And I want to think about any kind of information design that may well prove necessary.

I don't want this to function as a diary, I want it to be a practical document that gathers my thoughts together, okay? Got it, buster?

## Asset review v.1

### Purchased

* [Saraha Desert Landscape](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/sahara-desert-landscape-72780)
  * **Author:** Black Sun
  * **Category**: 3D > Environments > Landscapes / 3D Landscapes
  * **Medium**: Terrain/Landscape, Skybox (?)
  * **Purchased**: 7 May 2021
  * Just noticed this is in a series of categories: 3D > Environments > Landscapes. Could that be a useful thing to include on the didact? Yes probably.
  * It's a fairly large terrain textured to look like the Sahara Desert (I don't know how accurate it is, I suppose you could also say it "is" the Sahara Desert if you wanted to), nice detailed bumpy sand normal map, nice rippling dunes
  * This is a big decision potentially because it's the actual environment of the entire exhibition
  * Evocations of *Ozymandias*, evocations of Marfa and the Chinati Foundation, evocations of wandering lost in the desert and Biblical stuff
  * It's very big and yet it costs so little!
  * It's very repetitive and information light and yet it costs so much!
  * Actually that duality of "It's so cheap because..."/"It's so expensive because..." is a useful framing for assets when I'm thinking about them

* [PBR Statues Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/pbr-statues-pack-91623)
  * **Author**: Maksim Bugrimov
  * **Category**: 3D > Environments > Fantasy / 3D Fantasy
  * **Medium**: 3D Models (?)
  * **Purchased**: 11 May 2021
  * It's a set of high resolution and fancy-looking statues that dabble in cultural appropriation.
  * PBR apparently means Physically Based Rendering. It has a bunch of light and reflection probes. Basically they seem like they're trying to be super fancy statues, and I suppose that they succeed at that!
  * I chose them first (after the desert) as something kind of typically "museum ready" that would stabilize the project and my own process of curation, a kind of back to basics thing. They look pretty nice in the desert and they "make sense" in an easy way.
  * They set up potential tensions with assets that are lower or different resolutions or styles, they're also relatively small in scale, they're also deeply inanimate and don't "do" anything.
  * They seem to exist for set decoration of a similarly fancy level of some kind of Uncharted-adjacent game? That's what they evoke for me. Third person action exploration. Actually I wonder if genre is a curatorial standpoint. Variety of genre.

### Considerations

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/10-simple-spaceships-4709
  * Cartoon spaceship models x 10
  * Has that "recommended by our users" stamp of approval
  * Fundamentally it's... just some spaceships
  * In many ways this feels oddly similar to the statues... a collection of objects... different art style though, which is clearly a diversity consideration

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/100-low-poly-head-wear-items-128855
  * 100 low poly hats is pretty fucking funny
  * Definitely want to get some LARGE AMOUNT OF X thing(s) in there
  * They could be in a pile?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/125-low-poly-uildings-89838
  * 125 buildings is pretty intriguing, 200 prefabs
  * Interesting they don't seem to be assembled into a place, just buildings on their own?
  * Points out a difference between assets that are presented as objects and assets presented with an eye to their actual use in a game (e.g. here's the buildings and here's a world with those buildings)
  * So could be worthwhile as a brute amount - again there's some chance to configure these in some interesting way?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/18th-century-door-and-window-pack-4433
  * Doors and windows
  * I like the idea of a component part of a building divorced from its actual context like this
  * Plus imagery like a door in the desert is so classically evocative?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/industrial/200l-metal-barrel-with-substance-37598
  * Just three prefabbed barrels is funny (though there's a lot of customaization stuff which is interesting)

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/weapons/2-handed-frost-axe-20503
  * An axe... there's definitely a need for one or more "it's just this little thing" entries right?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/weapons/35-guns-weapons-and-pick-ups-lowpoly-98744
  * Some guns - probably something I "have to" have right? Weapons?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/3d-alphabet-122263
  * Characters - Language is a nice one

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/interior/3d-asset-pack-russian-izba-cabin-194082
  * A Russian cabin
  * Interesting because it's a room, though doesn't look like they've got a demo scene properly done?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/3d-castle-level-textures-182077
  * Really interestingly awkward, looks kind of isometric despite being 3D?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/furniture/3d-furniture-pack-163118
  * Furniture is a must
  * Has a sample scene that I'm guessing will be some kind of room?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/3d-pixel-vehicle-pack-devil-s-garage-104162
  * Some cars

* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/3d-scans-forest-pack-133837
  * A scan of a forest - looks like it has a scene inside a really awkward box which could be beautiful as an installation

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/guns/45mm-pistol-163916
  * Just one gun
  * Something like this has comedy value in terms of paying a lot for just a gun?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/4-forest-trees-468
  * Trees are appealing
  * Nature is appealing

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/electronics/70s-radio-pbr-150035
  * Pretty beautiful radio...

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/insects/73-animated-butterflies-164871
  * 73 ANIMATED BUTTERFLIES! SAY NO MORE!

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/75-road-props-17511
  * Signage is an interesting one

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/900-rocks-stones-pack-for-rpg-rts-39820
  * A lot of fucking rocks

* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/9t5-low-poly-arsenal-161274
  * Another one with a room for display which is interesting. Plus it's weaponry.
  * This creator has a bunch of stuff in this vein
  * e.g. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/9t5-low-poly-casino-166968
  * e.g. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/9t5-low-poly-bowling-alley-modular-132238
  * e.g. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/9t5-low-poly-arsenal-161274
  * e.g.  https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/9t5-low-poly-convenience-store-157383
  * I think the convenience store is the winner? Wait there's a church

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/abandoned-house-94448
  * An abandoned house is nice...
  * But also: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/abandoned-village-pack-161219

* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/humans/adam-stylized-lowpoly-male-character-181863
  * Lumberjacky guys. Niiiiice.

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/adonis-aerospace-168963
  * Actual spaceships to scale is cool... vehicles...

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/tools/adjustable-wrench-180374
  * Ha ha an adjustable wrench. Sooooo basic.

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/adonis-city-low-poly-165613
  * A city! Probably has a scene with it citified?
  * This is making me think about the problems of the desert landscape though... it's fine for some things to be in the sand but some stuff that's larger might get quite fucked over by that?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/air-conditioner-37139
  * One example of an air conditioner.
  * An air conditioner in the desert is funny.
  * Also just a really prosaic object is fun.

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/allien-creature-157071
  * Pleasingly gross alien
  * General idea of character models in different kinds
  * You can see some sort of typology building up that it would be useful to represent?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/american-desert-town-trailer-50958
  * A trailer is nice

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/an-abandoned-castle-53485

  * Ancient knight is pretty sweet looking

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/historic/ancient-pyramid-175410
  * Fancy pyramid
  * All this continues to make me think a lot about cultural appropriation

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/animal-pack-47588
  * An animal pack
  * A genre so worth looking at a number before buying one

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/animated-cardboard-box-32492
  * A cardboard box that can open and close... fancy.

* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/animated-farm-windmill-windpump-143450
  * Farm windmill. I need it.

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/animated-racing-arrows-78717
  * A UI element (racing arrows) is quite interesting

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/anime-character-code-lanky-contain-vrm-183464
  * Lots of anime characters
  * This one has a backstory: "Character name : Code:Lanky / Character age:Unknown / Character information:From a Western country, living with her husband in a mountains villa. Because her husband made a lot of money in his career, his personality became increasingly arrogant . The relationship between the husband and wife gradually expanded, and fell in love with other women ,which eventually led to tragedies. In order to avenge the unfeeling husband, a series of avenge were launched : Bloody Action..."
  * That idea is pretty alluring... built in narrative
  * ALso just interesting the extent to which creators do or do not include this kind of thing
  * Some kind of rendering of the creator's description is really interesting and appealing... what they choose to emphasize etc...

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/interior/antique-fireplace-115525
  * Antiques is a thing
  * This is a fireplace which is quite fun and cosy

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/food/apples-perfect-and-bite-664
  * A bunch of apples
  * I mean, how the fuck am I going to work with all this? So many things are so funny!

* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/arc-ai37-007-126328
  * Fancy room
  * Very realistic etc. pretty good candidate though has a lot of requirements in terms of settings...

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/ash-tray-cigarette-140172
  * Ashtray and cigarette
  * Yes I'm drawn to the really boring and mundane stuff

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/auto-rikshaw-tuk-tuk-low-poly-3d-vehicle-model-13143
  * Do love a baby taxi
  * This makes me wonder to what extent this could end up being a more personal exhibition?
  * Could I tell a story of my own with the curation?
  * Part of the problem in general is that there's no story to $4.99 just a range

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/auto-rikshaw-tuk-tuk-low-poly-3d-vehicle-model-13143
  * Autumn Horror Trees
  * COME ON! That name

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/b3-building-interior-exterior-with-furnitures-108359

  * Bandanas
  * The head prefab really makes it...

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/furniture/beige-towel-66181
  * A beige towel
  * The ultimate deflation?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/sea/boats-pack-1-113473
  * Boats... another vehicle. Funny in a desert.
  * This is making me think about how some objects will inherit narrative properties from their situation in the landscape where others probably won't? Notably through a match of realisms? And scale...

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/mammals/bottlenose-dolphin-128643
  * A dolphin
  * Quite amazing, animated.

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/boxing-ring-large-179420
  * A boxing ring
  * This is making me think about bending $4.99 more toward architecture and implied spaces?
  * But is that just ANOTHER project that would be really interesting to do with free assets instead?
  * Diversity still feels like it should be king if my focus is on the price point

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/industrial/breakable-crate-3905
  * Breakable crate
  * Intriguing because the user could actually interact with this one, it's just a collision...

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/roadways/bridge-vol-3-156392
  * A bridge... infrastructure...

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/broken-buildings-pack-11578

  * Quite a nice interior cabin

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/furniture/cabin-interior-household-items-furniture-pack-with-interactive-c-138278
  * Intriguing with the interactive stuff
  * Could I activate their specific interactive bit through prox?
  * Prooooobably not

* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/camping-props-pbr-193403
  * Camping... nice evocation of something to do in the desert...

* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/guns/cap-gun-with-arms-38686
  * This is proooobaby too amazing not to include? Especially pending what the disembodied arm looks like?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/cardboard-159860
  * Some cardboard. I mean, yeah.
  * There's a lot of this category!
  * https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/furniture/cardboard-boxes-hdrp-compatible-164898

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/cargo-starship-a001-96847

  * Cartoon is a big keyword
  * He can do a flip...

  * Nice.

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/casually-dressed-man-129831
  * Casually Dressed Man
  * I can't stand how great some of these categories are

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/chain-link-fence-29463
  * Chain Link Fence
  * Beautiful

### Notes on the search

* By starting with ascending order by name I'm immediately seeing packs definitely by the number of things, like 100 hats or 10 spaceships
* I'm largely thinking in terms of prefabs as a way to demo these pieces "as intended", but of course many 3D objects are instrumented in different ways, to the extent of having different settings and shaders - to do that justice I'd have to either have a combinatorial presentation (ala Unity water) or make them interactive, neither of which I plan to do. But it's a truth about the materials.
* Seeing cars over and over is starting to make me wonder about whether things could potentially be positioned near each other as a kind of comedy chain of relationships? Realistic car beside a cartoon cart? Invite those very specific comparisons? Also thinking about Patrick Pound and more conceptual connections and jokes?
* Looking into some package contents it starts looking to me a lot like some things may end up incompatibal (e.g. what if they rely on a specific rendering pipeline?) or just super confusing to actually use?
* Situating objects on the terrain could end up occluding important stuff or make larger flat stuff kind of unusable? Do I need platforms?
* If I load 96 assets per page there are 63 pages of assets at $4.99 - should I be coming up with some kind of democratizing approach where I only buy one asset per page or similar? Or does that just return me to things like the alphabet and numbers (36 items) - though with numbers it's "starts with 1" rather than has literally the number 1 at the start?
* In essence I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed by the potentially horrifyingly large selection process if I just propose to look at every single page - I've reached page 5 of 63 as I write this and each page is some WORK (I've been doing it for well over an hour, probably longer... can easily imagine looking at every page taking like 16+ hours, and I kind of question what I'll even be left with after that? There are many, many interesting assets.)
* Another option is purely random selection, but then I'm just abdicating responsibility for what ends up in it, and I've already broken that with the landscape and if it chose another landscape I'd be in trouble anyway
* I can imagine going by categories (vehicles, characters, buildings, interiors, etc.) but it gets really arbitrary and false done that way...
* The advantage to "one per page" or "one every N assets" would just be the ability to know I'm picking one amongst a group? There's just too much interesting stuff. A v r free would be an interesting follow-up by the way. Eh. v r $0 (like a weird prequel movie hehe)
* FUCK this is challenging.
* OKAY, part of the problem is that almost EVERYTHING IS AMAZING, there are just so many interesting things to look at in all of this... starts to feel like I could curate just a slice through at one item per page and go ahead with it because there are usually a significant number per page that I find very, very interesting
* I keep oscillating between "choose per page" and then also "choose per category" and some combination of those. The choose per page strategy risks building a non-diverse set where I get to later pages and am scraping the metaphorical barrel mesh trying to find a specific representative, but the choose per category makes it hard to find things and also probably hard to hit all the categories?
* Probably makes sense to try to make a list of "what I want" somehow... but some of these things just have real je ne sais quoi about them... half eaten apples? I mean, how can you categorize and pick for something like that? It's just so great?
* OH SHIT UNITY HAS DEEPER CATEGORIES THAN I THOUGHT?!
  * Characters
    * Animals
      * Birds
      * Fish
      * Insects
      * Mammals
      * Reptiles
    * Creatures
    * Humanoids
      * Fantasy
      * Humans
      * Sci-Fi
    * Robots
  * Environments
    * Dungeons
    * Fantasy
    * Historic
    * Industrial
    * Landscapes
    * Roadways
    * Sci-Fi
    * Urban
  * Props
    * Clothing
      * Accessories
      * Armor
    * Electronics
    * Exterior
    * Food
    * Furniture
    * Guns
    * Industrial
    * Interior
    * Tools
    * Weapons
  * Vegetation
    * Flowers
    * Plants
    * Trees
  * Vehicles
    * Air
    * Land
    * Sea
    * Space
* HOWEVER note that not everything is in one of those categories. How would you find the uncategorized things? Or do I just ignore them? And who defined those categories anyway? Like, you can't just go down to the leaves and get full coverage
* Gosh though it would be neat to just say "sample every category"? Maybe even two things per category to get a sense of comparison within them?
* I'm feeling PRETTY SWAYED by that strategy guys...

## Asset review v.2

Now that I've decided on Unity's category system I'm going to profile the categories with the aim of choosing two assets from each "leaf". Before I begin, let me look at the availability in the categories, though, and any issues around being forced to buy assets that just won't work together. So, observations...

* Insects (6) and Armor (9) are the smallest categories, but that should still be enough to work with
* The environments worry me the most, but I can see from Dungeons as an example that they contain plenty of things that aren't giant landscapes that would be hard tow ork with
* Environments are often "packs" which should be fine too - can show their sample scene or just the modular pieces

Hmmm, in short I think this is going to be fine, so let's start some reviews and choosings.

### 3D > Animations

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/zombie-starter-mocap-animation-pack-61492#content
  * Weird trying to distinguish this from other sets of models but these ARE nice animations and it's interesting to draw attention to that with the informational plinth?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/personality-animations-pack-161134
  * Quite like how utterly basic the base model is here
  * And the idea of a "confident" walk is neat
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/9t5-gesture-animations-164906
  * Something a bit mesmerizing about this one too though... hand gestures are interesting

### 3D > Characters

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/cartoon-chef-149364
  * There's something definitely funny about the cartoon chef and his flip
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/pbr-mechanical-robot-character-vol-02-106195
  * Pretty cool robot... belongs in robots obviously, but here it is
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/3d-creature-stump-pack-55399
  * Definitely something funny about a stump pack
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/humans/super-low-poly-dudes-6619
  * Super low poly dudes
  * And they dance! Though that may just be mixamo
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/anime-character-code-lanky-contain-vrm-183464
  * I really like lanky!
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/prisoner-02-107465
  * OH MAN. Prisoner two.
  * There's also prisoner one. It would be quite funny to buy both separately and have them separate to point out some interesting pricing things people do?

I'm kind of sold on the prisoner option.

### 3D > Characters > Animals

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/animal-pack-deluxe-v2-144071
  * Hard to go past an animal pack deluxe you know
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/low-poly-rigged-animals-123656
  * Another pack but low poly, nice comparison? Even down to the "which animals" thing?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/trilobite-61308
  * A trilobyte! By Junnichi Suko though

I think the two packs here are pretty fine

### 3D > Characters > Animals > Birds

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fanimals%2Fbirds&price=4-4&orderBy=1

* https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fanimals%2Fbirds&price=4-4&orderBy=1
  * A chicken - notably it's "recommended by our users" in the UI, which is no doubt some bullshit marketing, but if ever category happened to have this I could potentially always/usually priortize it?
  * Is animated etc., will have to think about how to display animations (loop them all, just show the most appropriate one like idling?)
* OMABU has created some really charming low poly animals, should include one somewhere (but probably only one to avoid repeating creators)
* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/birds/cartoon-owl-forest-environment-67572
  * Quite like this one because of the environment - the idea you would buy not just the owl but the place the owl is sitting
* !! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/birds/seagull-larus-canus-109558
  * A seagull that's fairly realistic is intriguing, the idea it could kind of walk around in the space near the plinth would be neat?

I'm leaning cartoon owl and seagull.

### 3D > Characters > Animals > Fish

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fanimals%2Ffish&price=4-4&orderBy=1

* Junnichi Suko makes some pretty nice realistic fish
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/fish/swordfish-pbr-174772
  * A fancy swordfish too...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/fish/low-poly-fish-pack-1-177981
  * A low poly fish pack, nice to pair with a realistic fish?

So leaning toward the pack and then one of the realistic fish... something about the Suko stuff is appealing... a craftsperson of fish...

### 3D > Characters > Animals > Insects

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fanimals%2Finsects&price=4-4&orderBy=1

There are only 6!

* Oh but the butterflies are there yesssssss! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/insects/73-animated-butterflies-164871
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/insects/egypt-pack-spider-122734
  * Is it cultural "appropriation" to have something like this as an Egypt Pack?
  * It's quite a useful one because it has such heavy game implications - like these are enemies in variations that you would fight...

Pending Egypt I guess the two I cite there are my favs...

### 3D > Characters > Animals > Mammals

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fanimals%2Fmammals&price=4-4&orderBy=1

Massive category.

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/mammals/cu-cat-10767#content
  * Cu Cat is funny and Recommended By Our Users.
  * I like the idea of internet cuteness within this world of games, implies another kind of Nintendogs sort of game
* OMABU and Suko are both represented heavily here again
* There's also a Cu Puppy if you like dogs - maybe that's fun as a more direct Nintendogs ref?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/mammals/whale-simple-3d-model-59288
  * Hard to go past a whale... makes me think of THHGTTG

Huh - the selection here is actually a bit small because it's so dominated by OMABU... this may be the section I take an OMABU for that reason? So probably an OMABU and the Cu Puppies...

### 3D > Characters > Animals > Reptiles

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fanimals%2Freptiles&price=4-4&orderBy=1

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/reptiles/allosaurus-and-skeleton-37858
  * Recommended
  * A dinosaur is always good right?
  * This is Suko though so have to be careful
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/reptiles/t-rex-model-49824
  * A T-Rex...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/reptiles/japanese-tree-frog-187864
  * Nice little Japanese Tree Frog... quite like the understated nature of it...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/reptiles/raptor-dinosaur-83903
  * This raptor is pretty nice though... very nicely animated...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/reptiles/tyrannosaurus-rex-dinosaur-32643
  * More T-Rexes...
* Lizards in Leotards is a key creator here

Possible getting two dinosaurs is a way to go, compare the T-Rexes? Alternatively a big and small, with the tree frog and one of the dinos. The raptors are nice too. Some good range of choices available.

### 3D > Characters > Creatures

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fcreatures&price=4-4&orderBy=1

No subcategories for this one, just 259 sweet, sweet creatures. Of which I guess I'm just picking two. I suddenly wonder whether I could pick representative samples instead, but that's just getting confusing.

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/dark-dragon-123448
  * The Recommended one is a Dark Dragon
  * Kind of similar to a dinosaur of course
  * It's nice enough?
* There are some fucked up looking packs from Maksim Bugrimov (who made my statues) that make me kind of want to replace the statues...
  * Oh fuck the video for this one is good https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/humanoid-creatures-pack-162689
  * Like an unintentional parody of the Moulin Rouge or something
  * I may need this
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/rpg-ogre-pack-pbr-mobile-159080
  * Nice ogre
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/mythological-creatures-pack-norse-173135
  * These are quite interesting creatures - amazing scale variation within the pack...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/reaper-boss-pbr-113262
  * There's quite a lot of really intense kind of Dark Souls stuff around

So I guess I'd lean toward Maksim's dancing cabaret and the Norse Mythological creatures for the scale?

### 3D > Characters > Humanoids

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fhumanoids&price=4-4&orderBy=1&rows=96

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/male-hair-expansion-pack-cute-series-179582
  * That's a lot of hair my friend... I like that...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/man-wearing-suit-129895
  * I do like a man in a suit
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fps-hand-jacket-84616
  * Just some arms and hands, yes please
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/casually-dressed-man-129831
  * Ah yes, the casually dressed man. I love you.

Some good choices in here... probably casually dressed man and the FPS hands? Or the hair? Hmm.

### 3D > Characters > Humanoids > Fantasy

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fhumanoids%2Ffantasy&price=4-4&orderBy=1

Feels kind of similar to the previous set... they were pretty humanoid, but whatever?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fantasy/evil-fire-demon-122741
  * Recommended
  * More cute than interesting though?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fantasy/voxel-fantasy-characters-pack-92617
  * A chance to include some voxels
  * 60+ characters is intriguing
* Most of these are kind of characters in the sense of a human style enemy, they're quite boring
* The female characters are pretty embarrassing
* Lots of repeated companies/creators in this set...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fantasy/medieval-fantasy-ice-king-171297#content
  * Something like this maybe? Struggling with this...

So yes to the voxels and then unsure on a second one to be honest.

### 3D > Characters > Humanoids > Humans

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Fhumanoids%2Fhumans&price=4-4&orderBy=1

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/humans/liam-lowpoly-character-100007
  * Liam
  * The Recommended one
  * I like this idea of characters with names, who are already sort of people?
  * Almost like hiring an actor
  * This is by AKISHAQS which made various other things so would need to look out for overlap
  * They also have other similar ideas, e.g. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/humans/kira-lowpoly-character-100303
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/humans/adam-stylized-lowpoly-male-character-181863
  * YESSSSSS. Adam. Lumberjacky sexy men.
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/humans/firefighter-in-aluminized-flame-proof-suit-185041
  * This is quite beautiful thanks to the suit...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/humans/sport-woman-city-people-184765
  * Sport Woman City People is pretty funny
  * There's something funny about this one
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/humans/asobi-chan-ver-shinobi-108111
  * Definitely something to the anime thing

Leaning silver custome and the lumberjacks

### 3D > Characters > Humanoids > Sci-Fi

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/sci-fi/robot-sci-fi-pbr-194064
  * Pretty fancy robot person
  * Maybe bordering into sexism? Hard to say
  * Controversy in the reviews! A claim it's stolen from Apex Legends. Huh. Avoid.
* These categories are really dominated by a limited set of people
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/sci-fi/scifihuman01-39614
  * Something slightly arresting about this guy?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/sci-fi/sci-fi-vr-hand-2-0-188394
  * Oooohhhh VR hands that's interesting!
  * I wonder how big they are?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/sci-fi/cyborg-kamikaze-53637
  * He looks too hot, could be funny

Leaning toward the scifi human and the hands here.

### 3D > Characters > Robots

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fcharacters%2Frobots&price=4-4&orderBy=1

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/robots/sci-fi-multi-purpose-robot-129301
  * A multipurpose robot? It's the Recommended
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/robots/low-poly-scifi-turrets-107425#content
  * I like the idea of the staging this has though the things themselves are pretty unintersting
  * The imagery on the asset story already presents it like it's in a gallery..
* Marcelo Barrio is the dominant voice here
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/robots/mech-crawler-107422
  * Kind of neat?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/robots/brute-robot-173508
  * Pretty nice robot... Marcelo again

Tricky. Perhaps taking a rist on the turrets and their staging as well as a Barrio (like the Brute Robot)?

### 3D > Environments

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fenvironments&price=4-4&orderBy=1&rows=96

Oh boy.

### 3D > Environments > Dungeons

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fenvironments%2Fdungeons&price=4-4&orderBy=1

This is an area where I worry a touch about things that are too big? But hopefully not?

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/medieval-dungeon-torture-chamber-131181
  * A pretty impressiv dungeon. I'm SUPER curious about the issue of getting in and out of a space like this though?
* The environmental stuff is one of those moments where we kind of get to Kabokov style things though right?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/medieval-treasure-113695
  * Glinty sparkly treasure...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/mine-92461
  * Interesting how manyu of these are modular of course
  * Both takes away from the inherent artistry but is so lovely and practical
  * This is pretty neat
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/new-dungeon-pack-modular-low-poly-174175
  * Low poly is always fun and worth having?
* I guess for this category having two actual dungeons makes an amount of sense
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/dungeon-3d-starter-162930#content
  * Something pleasingly amateurish here?

This will be hard to choose. I think two dungeons/spaces is the way to go but now I wonder about space in a broader sense actually. I wonder if I can expand my desert?

### 3D> Environments > Fantasy

* This is where my Maksim comes from, so I'd still pick two and forget the statues I think
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/fantasy-church-69453
  * Nice church though you can't go in... I like the intermediate resolution
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/fantasy-windmill-69647
  * I do like a windmill
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/fantasy-ruins-pack-12207
  * Obviously. Yes. We need some ruins and here they are.
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/medieval-houses-watermill-and-props-pack-123866
  * Something interesting here with the mechanism of the watermill
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/titan-town-47104
  * ENORMOUS. Kind of wonder if it's conceivable to transport to my desert
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/hq-medieval-forge-150002
  * YEAH this is pretty nice...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/fantasy-town-mobile-19792
  * Something interesting about mobile-ready
  * Also more designed for far off camera so interesting to look at them at large scale in FPS...

Hmmm there's some good stuff here really. Leaning to Fantasy Ruins Pack and Medieval Forge I think.

### 3D > Environments > Historic

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fenvironments%2Fhistoric&price=4-4&orderBy=1

  * Lovely potential though and classic desert material
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/historic/ruined-desert-environment-120275
  * Interestingly appropriate, possibly should lean this way for some assets?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/historic/old-farmhouse-34831
  * Quitebeautiful...

Quite a lot of options here, tough competition. The Pyramid, the Wharf, the Western City, the Desert Ruins

### 3D > Environments > Industrial

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/hydropower-station-1929
  * Recommended
  * Seems like it would be fucking huuuuuge?
  * Started to ask the question of whether some assets would/should be displayed INSIDE other assets? But I think not?
  * Broadens out ideas for other projects though...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/apocalypse-pack-58281
  * Oh Maksim, you know me too well. An apocalypse pack.
  * Don't think this is the best use of his one asset for me though.
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/trailer-house-165578
  * Really nice trailer... shame you can't go in though.
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/abandoned-church-147858
  * Claims to have an interior which is intriguing
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/industrial-warehouse-building-167860
  * Quite appealingly banal
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/station-v1-103418
  * Oh I LIKE this one...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/hermetic-door-121876
  * This is poetic for sure...

Some great options in here. Station v1 for sure. Trailer is neat and so is the church and the warehouse... good options here. Hermetic door too. Hmm.

### 3D > Environments > Landscapes

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fenvironments%2Flandscapes&price=4-4&orderBy=1

This is maybe where I run into trouble if they're all/mostly terrains? There can only be one?

* So I already have Sahara Desert Landscape, meaning I only need one other.
* https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fenvironments%2Flandscapes&price=4-4&orderBy=1
  * So Skyboxes are another interesting one though I can't quite get excited about it...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/cavern-entrances-18283
  * Quite like these cavern entrances
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/realistic-stones-and-ground-texture-65301

  * I do like an apocalypse
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/low-poly-landscapes-campsite-124422
  * This campsite is super charming, this maaaay be the winner?

Campsite I think? That or some rocks.

### 3D > Environments > Roadways

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/roadways/bridge-vol-2-156136
  * Quite like bridges... there are a few others too
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/roadways/traffic-and-roadside-objects-107369
  * Urban signage and stuff? Quite good...

Maybe it's those two?

### 3D > Environments > Sci-Fi

  * It's the sun! Can it be on the ground? How big is... the sun?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/space-center-pack-2-0-175735
  * An entire space centre... soooo weird...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/crash-landed-ship-57065
  * Something cool about this.. the implication is crashed and then there's a plinth

  * A nice corridor... something nice about transitional spaces?

  * A moon base! Jesus...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/sci-fi-modular-interiors-vol-1-116547
  * More interior tunnels... I like that...

There's a lot to like here... perhaps the crashed ships and one of the corridors? or the moon base?

### 3D > Environments > Urban

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fenvironments%2Furban&price=4-4&orderBy=1

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/simple-town-cartoon-assets-43500
  * Recommended
  * I think I already own this?
  * Yeah I do... so it would be "free", haha. It's a pretty interesting possibility... big though...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/mogadishu-lighthouse-169674
  * Fuck me that is specific
  * Mogadishu Lighthouse
  * REALLY beautiful. Okay. BUY it.
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/cinema-cartoon-mobile-ready-195284
  * A cinema is really appealing potentially

  * I like the idea you could be contemplating living there...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/easy-block-81115
  * So cinema... appealingly partial

In the end I don't think I can go past the Cartoon Town and the Mogadishu Lighthouse

### 3D > Props > Clothing > Accessories

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fprops%2Fclothing%2Faccessories&price=4-4&orderBy=1

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/clothing/accessories/bandana-face-masks-162265
  * I don't think I can live without these banadanas modeled on little heads
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/clothing/accessories/fantasy-rings-68388
  * Rings... I'm quite curious about how big or small they are?
  * Will they need a plinth-cube?
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/clothing/accessories/m-27-low-poly-hats-2-93642
  * Something to be said for just a lot of hats...
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/clothing/accessories/ultimate-low-poly-hat-collection-166457
  * Even more hats
  * Funny how they can evoke stuff like a graduation
  * Many hat packs include a headdress which is pretty offensive potentially
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/clothing/accessories/cavalier-hat-87705
  * That's a pretty expensive single hat

I'm leaning rings and bandanas, but I kind of want the storytelling power of hats...

### 3D > Props > Clothing > Armor

https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d%2Fprops%2Fclothing%2Farmor&price=4-4&orderBy=1

* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/clothing/armor/slavic-shields-159411
  * Nice shield, yep
* https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/clothing/armor/ultimate-hat-knight-133217
  * Solid knight helmet "hat"

By the way there's a small problem with the curatorial strategy of the categories which is all the higher level categories can have things in them that AREN'T in a sub category.

In this case most obviously "Clothing" has a lot more in it than the things represented in Accessories and Armor. It'd be slightly harder to do, but I could also include pieces from categories higher up.

The problem being where does that end? Taken to the extreme it would mean... 44 categories to cover (ever individual category and subcategory), which would be 88 assets (if I were doing two per category still like Noah's ark which I do like) which would cost... US$439 or CAD$540. Which... well it's fine, it's not THAT much money but it's more than I was planning on? But also who fucking cares? But also can I FIT 88 things? Probably right? Or I can make it work right?

Yeah okay I'm sold. Well I'll go an backfill the things that need back filling then I suppose. Don't want to miss genius or otherwise fascinating objects/environments just because the person who made them didn't chuck them in the right place. Though it'll be really hard to find things sometimes that AREN'T in a sub category? There's no negation option that I know of.

## Curatorial heuristics

My plan here is to develop a set of rationales for why one work and not another.

### Variety

* I think my baseline decision making should be around displaying a variety of assets at the price point so we can get a sense of the range, this will presumably invite the most questions from a player (and myself) and that's at the centre of this
* What kinds of categories are there that we can vary?
  * Resolution
  * Realism
  * Skill in execution
  * Size
  * Interactivity/activity
  * Genre connotations
  * Art style (cartoonish, low poly, realism, contemporary, etc.)
  * Quantity of elements (a single car, a collection of cars, a city, a room)
  * Genre of element (object, character, room, terrain, something else...)
  * Animation
  * Natural, fabricated
* There are a lot.

## Exhibition logistics

My plan here is to develop thoughts about how to position things in the space and why.

* Flatness. One issue is that some objects kind of require a flat space to actually work on. If you have a city street grid, say, you can't just embed the whole thing deep into sand dunes and still feel like you're doing is credit? So do I create cubic-platforms that support something like that and allow it to live its best life?
* Rooms. For interiors it may be necessary to build walls to enclose them depending on how they're implemented? I really loved my internal vision, at least, of walking into a kind of simple bunker and ending up in some beautiful room.
* Lighting. Various things look like they have their own lighting settings and preferences (and even rendering pipelines). I can imagine trouble on that front.

### Didacts

What shall they have on them?

* Name of the work
* Author of the work
* Category of the work (Is this like a medium? e.g. 3D > Environments > Landscapes)
* Price of the work ($4.99, duh)
* Purchase date/time of the work
* **Maybe** some kind of further information?
* **Ideally** some link to the official asset page
