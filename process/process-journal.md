# The starting idea; questions; a glance at Asset Store (06-05-2021 10:51)

Well here I am about to start thinking about this project in the actual harsh light of day instead of the dim light of the bathroom while I'm in the bath thinking of this game.

## The starting idea

As it came to me, the idea was to pursue that element of *v r 3* that was about price comparisons and assessments of the "worth" of water assets into a related game/exhibition purely about the cost of assets on the asset store.

My intial thought was that I would buy assets at different price points and then display them in some way that invites thought about what they're worth etc. Notably

* The idea of paying for something virtual at all (done to death but still important)
* The relationship of different kinds of measures of "quality" to price (resolution, size, apparent effort, relationship of asset to objects considered expensive in the first place, ++)
* The idea of instances and that multiple instances of the same item cost the same, e.g. 100 instances of a $1 asset cost $1, not $100
* Other things here?

Importantly I figure I can leverage the fact I can spend some money from a research account to not give a shit so much about paying for things I wouldn't pay for.

## Questions

I wonder if it's too vague for a player to get a grasp on. Obviously I can have the usual didacts etc. presenting the objects as costing money. I wonder if there's someway to make price comparisons a real thing (that could then leverage things like number of instances, scaling, etc.)? Or perhaps I "just" make installations that draw attention to those particular qualities of the objects in question?

I wonder if there's a need to focus in on a thematic area of the asset store? I mean, I think 3D models is the correct overall thing to look at, but should it only be "horses" or something insane like that? Are there enough horses? But then that because essentially another instance of v r 3 with a harder bent toward money. I guess the choice of items at different price points can really be a key part of it - I'll curate the objects for maximum fun for myself.

I wonder about the nature of the assets you buy - many assets are packs rather than a singular object. Many assets involve animations and interactivity in scripts rather than a static thing, and those things would need to be shown off.

I wonder about how much it could end up costing. If I limited myself to one item at a series of price points then

* $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 would costs a total of $188. Which is totally fine, but it's also only 7 distinct elements.
* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 would cost a total of $195 which is quite a nice sequence as well?
* What if I found a common price point and just bought a lot of stuff that costs that much? What if I only bought things that cost $4 or roughly that? (People seem to go for the .99 pricing model so perhaps not.)

I wonder what the actual range of prices on the Asset store is. Guess I'll have to... find out!

I wonder about the relationship between ratings and cost - should I be buying the highest rated thing at each price point as a way to navigate that? Should I be buying the highest and lowest rated things?

I wonder about the context/exhibition space and how that will interact with these ideas. There are many different ways to show an object the most obvious right now are

* A traditional gallery space with a focus on looking at them, one item per room, say, or something else
* A more "real" space like something with terrain and trees and all that shit
* A paid-for space in the first place (buy a gallery or a viking village or whatever)
* Some kind of surrealist plain where the imagined horses and other stuff is running around, lying there, etc.

Did that other game at IGF in 2019 already do this??? [circle0](https://igf.com/circle0)? No, not really.

## A glance at the Asset Store

Let's actually just take a look at this thing and see...

**Packs** - as I look at them I can see just dropping every available prefab somewhere and that's that (though this of course raises questions about price versus showing them in their best light? Like if I just dump things from a village pack in a pile am I really exhibiting them in a fair way?)

**Pricing** - so many things are at .99 I'm starting to wonder if I should call this *v r 4.99* or *v r 3.99* ha ha. Maybe I should. There are 62 3D assets priced at $4.99 by the way. If you bought them all it would cost you $309.38. Which is not actually out of the question! Huh. I mean... that's kind of fucking amazing... oh wait, maybe I fucked that up though... yeah I think there's a lot more than that, bugger. Yeah actually there's a bizarre hard line between FREE and $4.99. And there are WAAAAAAYYYY more than 62 things that cost exactly $4.99. Not doable, fuck. That said, I don't have to buy all of them... I do like the idea now of everything costing the same amount I think... and $4.99 is a fun price point for this. There are 6042 3D assets that cost $4.99 for the record, which would cost over $30,000 and probably not the best use of my money.

**Selection** - if I proceed with the idea of *v r $4.99* how can I then select specific items? I quite like this idea in general because I'm able to get 20 items per $100 (US) I spend, which feels like a good number for an investment. Even 20 thing would work. 26 things would be interesting if I can get an alphabet as a curation approach? Given there are 6042 that seems likely, but there's no alphabetical sort? Here's the base query anyway: [](https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d&price=1-4&orderBy=4). Do I need to literally just start look at 6000 assets and picking my favs? Maybe alpha and maybe some other criterion? I can already see there are a couple of environments in here which is a little bit interesting but might overwhelm the idea quite easily.

**This is going to work**. I mean compare these two just for hilarity:

* [Cyberpunk Cyber City](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/cyberpunk-cyber-city-fp-147894)
* [Dirty Mirror](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/furniture/dirty-mirror-117606)

That is fucking comedy GOLD my friend.

OKAY, so I think that just decides it for me on the $4.99 price point right now, I think it's easier to grasp and easier for me to populate the game with a diverse set of things.

Curation is going to be other some rule-based thing like alphabetization, or the "top 20" things that cost that much or whatever. Although I worry that a "merit" system may eliminate some really fucking funny terrible things? Oh and wait there is an alphabetization: [https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d&price=1-4&orderBy=5](https://assetstore.unity.com/?category=3d&price=1-4&orderBy=5)

I think it would make sense to only exhibit one work per creator to avoid samey things like low poly town construction kits etc.

Ooooo the [Cyber Room](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/cyberpunk-cyber-room-169139) could be very worthwhile.

Oh wow, so I'm officially excited about this one my friends. The curation needs some more thought but this is *absolutely* going to work and be kind of spectacular I think.
